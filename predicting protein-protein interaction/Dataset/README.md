We use the four datasets provided by “Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions Using Symmetric Logistic Matrix Factorization(2021)”. 

First, “pros_AB” and “PPI_human_2019” datasets contain proteins’ ids, sequences, and whether they interact or not. 
There are 8,161 and 315,934 pairs of proteins, respectively.

Second, “pro_index_human_2019” and “unip2fasta_human” datasets contain some information about proteins such as names, lengthes, genes, subcellular locations, and tissue specificities.
